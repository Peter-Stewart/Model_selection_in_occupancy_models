This repository contains code to fully reproduce the simulations and analyses in our paper ___Model selection in occupancy models: inference versus prediction___. 

**File List:**

* **Fig2_simulation.R** - code to reproduce the simulations, analyses and graphs in Figure 2 of our manuscript
* **Occ_Mbias.R** - code to run the occupancy simulations with M-bias present in the occupancy process only
* **Det_Mbias.R** - code to run the occupancy simulations with M-bias present in the detection process only
* **Occ_Det_Mbias.R** - code to run the occupancy simulations with M-bias present in both the occupancy and detection processes
* **Figures.R** - code to analyse the results of the three occupancy simulations and produce figures 4-6 in the main text and S1-S6 in the supplementary material
